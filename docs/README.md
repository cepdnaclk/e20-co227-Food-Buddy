## Introduction

Food wastage is a pressing global issue, with substantial amounts of quality food being 
discarded daily by restaurants, supermarkets, and grocery shops. This not only results in 
financial losses but also exacerbates environmental problems. The main reason for this 
problem is not being able to sell the products during its consumable time period. 
Food Buddy is a mobile application designed to address this challenge by creating a 
platform where shop owners can display unsold products nearing expiration at 
discounted prices. By connecting shops with potential buyers, the app aims to reduce 
food wastage while benefiting both parties: customers gain access to affordable food 
items, and shop owners minimize losses by selling surplus inventory. 
The app provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and shop owners. 
Customers can browse nearby discounts based on their location, while shop owners can 
efficiently manage and update product advertisements. Through this innovative 
approach, Food Buddy contributes to building a more sustainable future by tackling 
food waste effectively.
